## Javascript Fundamentals

### Executing Javascript
Javascript can be executed on a webpage in a number of ways, including:
- Executed directly in the console
- In a script tag within an html file
- In an external script, linked in your html document

### Variables
- Variables can be created using 'let', 'const' or 'var'.
- variables should only be declared once; repeated declarations result in an error. To overwrite a mutable variable, you just set the existing variable equal to a new value. Variables declared using 'const' are unmutable.
- Best Practices for naming:
    - Aliases for difficult to remember values known prior to execution, like color hex-codes, are stored as caps with underscores, e.g. COLOR_RED
    - Typical variables written in camelCase
