## Javascript Fundamentals

### Executing Javascript
Javascript can be executed on a webpage in a number of ways, including:
- Executed directly in the console
- In a script tag within an html file
- In an external script, linked in your html document

### Variables
- Variables can be created using 'let', 'const' or 'var'.
- variables should only be declared once; repeated declarations result in an error. To overwrite a mutable variable, you just set the existing variable equal to a new value. Variables declared using 'const' are unmutable.
- Best Practices for naming:
    - Aliases for difficult to remember values known prior to execution, like color hex-codes, are stored as caps with underscores, e.g. COLOR_RED
    - Typical variables written in camelCase
- To determine the variable type, use: typeof
- Common Data Types
    - Number, represents integers and floating point numbers
    - BigInt, for integer values that are greater than 2^53 in length
    - Strings
    - Booleans
    - Undefined, null are special values
    - Objects, used to store collections of data and more complex entities
### Expressions    
- If / Else syntax:
    ```
    let shoppingDone = false;
    let childsAllowance;

    if (shoppingDone === true) {
    childsAllowance = 10;
    } else {
    childsAllowance = 5;
    }
    ```
- Switch Statements: takes a single expression/value as an input, and then look through several choices until they find one that matches that value, executing the corresponding code that goes along with it. Syntax:
    ```
    switch (expression) {
    case choice1:
        run this code
        break;

    case choice2:
        run this code instead
        break;

    // include as many cases as you like

    default:
        actually, just run this code
    }
    ```
- Ternary Operator:  Tests a condition and returns one value/expression if it is true, and another if it is false. Can only take 2 choices, but can be more readable than 'if else' statements. Syntax:
    ```
    condition ? run this code : run this code instead

    #Example:
    const greeting = isBirthday
    ? 'Happy birthday Mrs. Smith â€” we hope you have a great day!'
    : 'Good morning Mrs. Smith.';
    ```
